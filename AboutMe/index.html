        Hey all! My name is David Peters, I'm from Tremonton, Utah. I'm majoring in Computer Engineering, but I want to learn Web Development.
        I'm married to my amazing wife, Sadie and we've been married for almost 6 months.

        In my freetime, I enjoy reading fantasy and sci-fi books. 3D Modeling and Printing. I own two of my own 3D Printers. 
        And love messing around with pretty much anything tech related.

        My favorite scripture is Mosiah 2:17: "And behold, I tell you these things that ye may learn wisdom; that ye may learn that when ye are in the service of your fellow beings ye are only in the service of your God."
